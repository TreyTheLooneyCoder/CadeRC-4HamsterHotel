> Comments: Looks good; Could use some padding/margins in several areas; 'Reserve a Room' is missing the 'Check Availabliity Button' Navbar needs to be made compatable with smaller screens; Add a 'Font-Align: Center' for 'Wheel of Luxury' Text and maybe a bit of margin/padding to the left and right; Make sure cards within the 'Our Rooms' section are centered; probably change the font to match the example better; Over all, the responisvness functions well enough;
